      <description>Only a few game franchises hold a special place in my heart; one of which is Call of Duty. There are a couple reasons for this, but I feel that the most significant reason is timing (or luck). Subjectively speaking, being between the ages of seven (maybe six) and fourteen during the &amp;lsquo;modern gaming explosion&amp;rsquo; of the early-mid 2000s is something I have a hard time putting into words.

      <description>Reflecting back on music at the turn of a new decade gave me the idea for a challenge: if I could create one album with a maximum of 14 songs from the last decade, how would I construct it? Who would I pick?

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Matt - a 28-year-old M.Sc. student currently residing in Ontario, Canada. Outside of research you can find me learning R, reading, exercising, outdoors, gaming (e.g., OSRS, board games) or listening to music (e.g., Darkest Hour, In Flames). After completing my M.Sc. I have my eyes set on joining the military for a few years and then consulting in the environmental field. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an internal fire to embark upon an uncommon societal arc while also being a part of something meaningful in the world.</description>
