Hey, I'm Matt - a 30-year-old geoscientist currently residing in BC's lower mainland! You can probably find me coding, reading, exercising, exploring the outdoors, gaming, or listening to music. After completing my M.Sc., I have my eyes set on doing fieldcraft in a uniform for a bit, then some science-related work; likely hydrogeology as the rocks and the water have the best stories to tell.
