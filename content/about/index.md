Hey, I'm Matt - a 29-year-old M.Sc. student currently residing in Ontario, Canada! Outside of research, you can probably find me learning R, reading, exercising, exploring the outdoors, gaming or listening to music (e.g., Darkest Hour, In Flames). After completing my M.Sc., I have my eyes set on doing fieldcraft in a uniform for a bit, then some science-related work; likely, hydrogeology (the rocks and the water have the best stories to tell). Ultimately, I've always had a drive to pursue an uncommon life arc and I'll see where that internal fire takes me.
